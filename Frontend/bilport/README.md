# How to run
Prerequisite:
Install node.js on your computer if you haven't installed it already

1. Open the bilport folder from your IDE (not the Frontend folder! I mean open the bilport folder inside it. Otherwise you'll get an error)
2. Open terminal
3. Type "npm install". Wait for packages to be installed.
4. Type "npm start".
5. It should be running now!
