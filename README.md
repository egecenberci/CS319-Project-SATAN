# CS319-Project-SATAN
My group's project for Bilkent's CS 319 Object Oriented Programming course.

Due to the erratic semester we experienced in Turkey because of the earthquake, and some work distribution and communication problems, the project couldn't reach its full potential.

See the Final Report in the reports folder to examine my work throughout the semester.

A concise project description can be found below; for further information, see the reports.

Project Bilport aimed to create an easy and reliable internship management system to handle the internship processes of Engineering Faculty undergraduate students at Bilkent University.
It was only partially successful in reaching its goal.
Bilport achieved a web application with different user interfaces depending on the user's role, uploading and downloading pdf files and offering a database to store these files relieving the registrar's office from its file sorting work.
However, some functionalities, such as feedback and file access after the first iteration and password-changing capability, were not achieved due to problems encountered during the implementation.
